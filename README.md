# National Geographic _under construction

In this assignment from The Odin Project, I was required to create a grid base CSS Library and use it. I decided
to remake the National Geographic website and it appears to make good use of a grid system, as well as showcasing a
clean layout.

The repository to the Grid Base Framework I made can be found [here](https://www.github.com/aznafro/flik/).

The original National Geographic site can be seen [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/).

And my live remake of the site using my grid based framework can be seen [here](https://aznafro.github.io/natgeo/).
